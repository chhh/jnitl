<title>JNITL - Java Native Interface Template Library</title>

<p>
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jni/index.html">JNI</a> is the programming interface when developing native libraries that work with Java. Unfortunately, this interface is designed to be compatible with C, and therefore it cannot take advantage of C++ language features.
<p>
	This project aims to bridge this gap by providing a C++ layer on top of JNI, and making it a lot easier to use.

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>
	The current version has the following features:
<ol>
	<li>Method/field access regrouped by types (so that they can be driven by other templates more easily)
	<li>Array access regrouped by types (so that they can be driven by other templates more easily)
	<li>Convenient method/field invocations that hide method/field IDs.
	<li>Convenient <tt>java.lang.String</tt> &lt;-> LPCSTR/LPCWSTR conversion
</ol>

<h3>TODOs</h3>
<p>
	This library can be extended in many ways, and here are some ideas. Volunteers are welcome.
<ol>
	<li>Support more platforms
	<li>Write a little Java tool that reads a class definition and generates a wrapper C++ code that access it through JNITL, so that you can write as follows:
<pre>
// assume you've translated java.io.File to Java::Io::File
void foo(jobject o) {
  Java::Io::File pFile = static_cast&lt;Java::Io::File>(o);
  pFile = pFile->getAbsoluteFile();
  jboolean exists = pFile->exists();
  if(exists) {
    ...
  }
}
</pre>
</ol>
<p>
	Unlike a Java library, where every unsed feature still bloats the application using it, C++ applications only pay for the features they actually use. So that allows us to add more features without worrying too much about the size bloat.


<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
	To use JNITL, first <a href="https://jnitl.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">download the distribution</a> and extract it somewhere. Then configure your C++ compiler and linker so that <tt>jnitl/include</tt> and <tt>jnitl/lib</tt> are searched by the compiler and the linker respectively.

<p>
	From your program, do the following:

<pre>
// in your stdafx.h header file
#include &lt;jnitl.h>
using namespace jnitl;	// if you want to.

extern JNIModule module;
</pre>

<pre>
// in your stdafx.cpp file
JNIModule module;
</pre>
